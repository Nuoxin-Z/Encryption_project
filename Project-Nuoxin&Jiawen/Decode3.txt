legend has it that above the roaring yellow river, there is a dragon gate that only appears every few years. countless yellow river carps, after arduous efforts to climb up and swim, gather at the place where the dragon gate is about to appear, waiting day and night. when the dragon gate appears, they will jump with all their strength. as long as they can jump over the dragon gate, they will become the ones soaring in the sky, the dragon that controls wind and rain.
